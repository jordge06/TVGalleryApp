# TVGalleryApp

## Important Notice
  - If you want to download the source code and run it to your PC. You will get an error because I removed 1 class that contains my API Key.
  - So to run the app you should make a Java Class named Constants inside the Folder called Utilities.
  - Then you need to register to https://www.themoviedb.org/ and get your own API KEY.
  - Lastly make a three constants variable inside the Constans class.
    - first: public static final String API_KEY = "paste your api key";
    - second: public static final String BASE_URL= "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/";
    - last: public static final String IMAGE_URL = "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/";
  - Everything should work perfectly. Thanks for using the app.
